                                <h5>DESIGNING A CULTURE OF DESIGN</h5>
                                <p>Workplace culture doesn’t start with beanbags, foosball tables, or a beer fridge, and
                                    it
                                    doesn’t
                                    end with neckties, PCs, or big corporations. It’s the unwritten rules, behavior,
                                    beliefs,
                                    and
                                    the motivations that enable good work to get done, or it’s what stifles a workforce.
                                    For
                                    design
                                    to be most effective and for designers to feel valued, we need to work in a culture
                                    that
                                    embraces design and allows it to succeed.</p>

                                <p>In Aaron’s session he will explore how to recognize the traits of organizations that
                                    *get*
                                    design, both large and small. He will share what those teams, departments, and
                                    companies
                                    have
                                    that others don’t, and more importantly, how to begin to change your own workplace’s
                                    culture.
                                    Once you’ve worked within a culture of design it’s almost impossible to imagine
                                    yourself
                                    anywhere else</p>

                                <p>Workplace culture doesn’t start with beanbags, foosball tables, or a beer fridge, and
                                    it
                                    doesn’t
                                    end with neckties, PCs, or big corporations. It’s the unwritten rules, behavior,
                                    beliefs,
                                    and
                                    the motivations that enable good work to get done, or it’s what stifles a workforce.
                                    For
                                    design
                                    to be most effective and for designers to feel valued, we need to work in a culture
                                    that
                                    embraces design and allows it to succeed.</p>

                                <p>In Aaron’s session he will explore how to recognize the traits of organizations that
                                    *get*
                                    design, both large and small. He will share what those teams, departments, and
                                    companies
                                    have
                                    that others don’t, and more importantly, how to begin to change your own workplace’s
                                    culture.
                                    Once you’ve worked within a culture of design it’s almost impossible to imagine
                                    yourself
                                    anywhere else</p>
